# Cluster Analysis of Obesity Levels

The goal of this project is to use various unsupervised learning approaches to perform cluster analysis on participant responses to group the responses into varying obesity levels.

The dataset used for this project is from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data contains participant demographic information and participant responses to various questions about their lifestyle. The data also includes the obesity levels of participants.
